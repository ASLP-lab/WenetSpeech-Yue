This project includes the inference code and configuration files for Llasa-1B-Yue, but does not include the BiCodec model weights (model.safetensors).
Due to GitHub’s 100MB file size limit, users must download the required weights manually.

Please download the BiCodec model weights (model.safetensors) from the following link:
[bicodec-sparkTTS](https://huggingface.co/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS-0.5B/tree/main)

After downloading, place the weight file at:
```
